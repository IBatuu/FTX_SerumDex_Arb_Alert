###Project in progress.
The project tries to catch arbitrage opportunities by leveraging one of the fastest exchanges and the fastest blockchain Solana.
Thanks to FTX supporting many blockchains and coins and wrapping them into SPL tokens, there can be arb opportunities.
The code has been written in a rush to catch the market volatility and opportunity. It is highly adjustable depending on the trader's equity and needs.
In the current form, it seems to work without any bugs but it is unbelievably messy and needs improvements to make it faster and more efficient.


###TO DOs:
*Discard the duplications
*Add classes for the dataset
*Create def's for all the functions
*Create a universal bot that loops through all the coins that can be arbed between ftx and serum dex
*Tweak and create the whole process for the websocket listening to achieve a faster and more efficient process
*Add transfer tokens fn
*Current arb is for one way, meaning buy from serum sell on ftx bc it is faster. However, the other route is also almost finished and will be added later on.

###DISCARDED
I used this script and similar, much improved, and tradable versions of this during the 2020-2022 bull market, yielding me huge returns. With the FTX exchange bankruptcy, this script is just a scrap now, thus I am not uploading any improved versions of this. However, this was a great example of how you can find alpha during extreme liquidity situations, in places where no one is willing look at
